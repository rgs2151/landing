        <h1> Nuttida Rungratsameetaweemana, PhD</h1>
        <p>Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering
        <br>
        Affiliate Faculty of Center for Theoretical Neuroscience
        </p>
        <p>
            Nuttida received her BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics from Middlebury College in 2014 and her PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego in 2020. Her graduate work with <a href="https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/">John Serences</a> and <a href="http://whoville.ucsd.edu/research.html">Larry Squire</a> integrated psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to investigate how the brain organizes probabilistic sensory information for flexible decision-making. 
            <br><br>
            Before joining Columbia in 2023, Nuttida was a Swartz Theoretical Neuroscience Fellow in the lab of <a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/">Terry Sejnowski</a> at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where she explored the computational principles of adaptive learning using biologically inspired deep learning models.

            Additionally, she was a visiting postdoctoral scientist in the lab of <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/labs/rutishauser.html">Ueli Rutishauser</a> at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, investigating the neural correlates of contextual information processing. She was also an inaugural Provostâ€™s Research Fellow as part of the Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative at Columbia University. Outside the lab, Nuttida enjoys cooking her favorite Thai comfort foods and experimenting with new recipes. She also loves drawing and spending time with her little sister.
