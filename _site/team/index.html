        <h1> Nuttida Rungratsameetaweemana, PhD</h1>
        <p>Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering
        <br />
        Affiliate Faculty of Center for Theoretical Neuroscience
        </p>
        <p>
            Nuttida received her BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics from Middlebury College in 2014 and her PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego in 2020. Her graduate work with <a href="https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/">John Serences</a> and <a href="http://whoville.ucsd.edu/research.html">Larry Squire</a> integrated psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to investigate how the brain organizes probabilistic sensory information for flexible decision-making. 
            <br /><br />
            Before joining Columbia in 2023, Nuttida was a Swartz Theoretical Neuroscience Fellow in the lab of <a href="https://cnl.salk.edu/">Terry Sejnowski</a> at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where she explored the computational principles of adaptive learning using biologically inspired deep learning models. 
            <br /><br /> 
            Additionally, she was a visiting postdoctoral scientist in the lab of <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/labs/rutishauser.html">Ueli Rutishauser</a> at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, investigating the neural correlates of contextual information processing. She was also an inaugural Provost’s Research Fellow as part of the Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative at Columbia University. Outside the lab, Nuttida enjoys cooking her favorite Thai comfort foods and experimenting with new recipes. She also loves drawing and spending time with her little sister.

        <h2>Robert Kim, MD, PhD</h2>
        <p>Affiliated Research Scientist</p>
        <p>Robert received his BS in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2012. Following his undergraduate studies, he worked in the lab of Hal Blumenfeld at Yale University, focusing on mechanisms of impaired consciousness in Childhood Absence Epilepsy. Robert then joined the Medical Scientist Training Program at UC San Diego, where he obtained his PhD in Neuroscience in 2020 and his MD in 2022. During his graduate research in the lab of Terry Sejnowski, Robert developed computational tools and frameworks to probe neural dynamics and identify neural correlates of working memory. Currently, Robert is a resident physician in Adult Neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center while continuing his research in the Nuttida lab and the lab of Ueli Rutishauser in the Cedars-Sinai Neurosurgery Department. His work focuses on developing computational models and analyzing human electrophysiology data to better understand the neural mechanisms of higher cognitive functions. Robert enjoys puppy watching and playing tennis.</p>

        <h2>Tomas G. Aquino, PhD</h2>
        <p>Postdoctoral Research Scientist</p>
        <p>Tomas received his BSc in Molecular Sciences from the University of São Paulo, Brazil in 2015. Subsequently, he did his PhD with John O'Doherty at Caltech, and was co-advised by Ueli Rutishauser at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. His work focused on single-neuron correlates of value learning and decision-making in the human brain. He obtained his PhD in Computation and Neural Systems in 2022. Currently, Tomas works on the intersection between flexible decision making and recurrent neural network models of perception and decision, leveraging human single neuron recordings. Tomas also enjoys planting tomatoes and playing jazz/bossa nova guitar.</p>

        <p>MD/PhD Student in Neurobiology &amp; Behavior</p>
        <p>Renee completed her BS in Neuroscience with a certificate in Statistics &amp; Data Science at Yale University in 2021, where she studied the neural mechanisms of behavioral impairment in a rat model of absence epilepsy in Hal Blumenfeld's lab. She then spent a year working with Carsen Stringer at Janelia using computational methods to study neural representations of behavior in mouse recordings of tens of thousands of neurons with behavioral keypoint tracking. In the Nuttida lab, she is interested in using modeling in combination with experimental data to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of neurostimulation on cognition in humans. Outside of lab, she enjoys playing [card, board, video] games, walking in parks, and exploring the city.</p>

        <p>Salma received her BS in Biology Bioinformatics from CUNY Hunter College in 2022. During her undergraduate studies, she worked in the lab of Eric Nestler at Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai. Salma then took part in the NIH Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program as a research scholar at Baylor College of Medicine in Kelly Bijanki’s lab and in collaboration with Sameer Sheth, where she studied the change in depression symptom severity of inpatient deep brain stimulation treatment. Currently, Salma is interested in exploring the neural mechanisms of perceptual and cognitive flexibility. Her project leverages single-neuron recordings in humans with methods from statistics and computational neuroscience. Outside the lab she enjoys reading, writing creative pieces, and exploring places in her hometown in Queens.</p>

        <p>Kaitlyn earned her B.E. in Biomedical Engineering from Stony Brook University in 2022 and her M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Columbia University in 2024. At Columbia, she joined Elizabeth Hillman’s lab, where she first used computational approaches to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and inform antibody selection for multiplexed imaging of human brain samples. She later shifted focus to widefield optical mapping, an in vivo imaging technique that captures neural and hemodynamic activity in the cortex of awake, behaving mice, to investigate neurovascular coupling and functional connectivity after drug perturbation. Kaitlyn now works jointly with the Nuttida lab as well as the labs of Elizabeth Hillman and Steven A. Siegelbaum. She is excited to combine in vivo imaging, behavior tracking, and computational techniques to study behavioral and neurological deficits of HCN1-linked developmental epileptic encephalopathy. Outside of the lab she enjoys photography, painting, and hiking.</p>
