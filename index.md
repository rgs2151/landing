Hey there! Iâ€™m a researcher based in New York City.

I build probabilistic models and reverse engineer the brain.
My work focuses on machine learning and neuroscience, particularly in creating explainable models
that bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and biological systems.

In my free time, I enjoy turning coffee into code, playing dota 2, and dreaming about the future. Read my [thoughts](/~rgs2151/posts/), [publications](/~rgs2151/publications/), or [resume](/~rgs2151/assets/resume.pdf) for more details. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rgs2151) or [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rgs2151/).
