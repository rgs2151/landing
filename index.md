Hey there! Iâ€™m a researcher based in New York City.

I build probabilistic models and reverse engineer the brain.
My work focuses on machine learning and neuroscience, particularly in creating explainable models
that bridge the gap between them. In my free time, I enjoy turning coffee into code and playing dota2.
