# Hypothesis Testing vs Bayesian Modeling

*Date: 12th March 2025*  
*Author: Rudra*

After working through our comprehensive Bayesian modeling series, you might wonder: "How does this compare to the classical statistics I learned in school?" This is a fundamental question that gets to the heart of two very different philosophies about uncertainty, evidence, and decision-making.

Let me tell you a story that illustrates the key differences...

## The Tale of Two Scientists

Imagine two scientists studying whether a new drug is effective. They both have the same data, but they approach the problem completely differently.

### Dr. Frequentist's Approach

Dr. Frequentist sets up her analysis like a court trial:

**The Setup:**
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** "The drug has no effect" (innocent until proven guilty)
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** "The drug has an effect" 
- **Goal:** Find evidence strong enough to reject H₀

She calculates a test statistic and gets a p-value of 0.03.

**Her Conclusion:** "If the drug truly had no effect, there's only a 3% chance I'd see data this extreme or more extreme. Since 3% < 5%, I reject the null hypothesis. The drug is effective."

**What she CAN'T say:** "There's a 97% chance the drug works" (This is a common misinterpretation!)

### Dr. Bayesian's Approach

Dr. Bayesian thinks differently:

**The Setup:**
- **Prior:** Based on previous studies, she believes there's a 30% chance the drug works
- **Likelihood:** She models how likely the observed data is under different effect sizes
- **Posterior:** She updates her beliefs using Bayes' theorem

**Her Process:**
$$P(\text{Drug Works | Data}) = \frac{P(\text{Data | Drug Works}) \times P(\text{Drug Works})}{P(\text{Data})}$$

After seeing the data, her posterior shows an 85% probability that the drug works.

**Her Conclusion:** "Given the data and my prior knowledge, I'm now 85% confident the drug is effective. Here's the full distribution of possible effect sizes..."

## The Fundamental Philosophical Differences

### 1. **What is Probability?**

**Frequentist View:** Probability is about long-run frequencies. "If I repeated this experiment infinite times under the same conditions, what fraction would give this result?"

**Bayesian View:** Probability is about degrees of belief or uncertainty. "Given what I know, how confident am I in this statement?"

### 2. **What Questions Can We Answer?**

**Frequentist:** 
- ✅ "What's the probability of seeing this data if H₀ is true?" (p-value)
- ❌ "What's the probability that H₀ is true?" (Not allowed!)

**Bayesian:**
- ✅ "What's the probability that H₀ is true given the data?" (Posterior probability)
- ✅ "What are all the possible parameter values and how likely are they?"

### 3. **How Do We Handle Prior Knowledge?**

**Frequentist:** Prior knowledge is largely ignored in the formal analysis. Each study stands alone.

**Bayesian:** Prior knowledge is explicitly incorporated and updated with new evidence.

## A Concrete Example: The Coin Flipping Dilemma

Let's say you flip a coin 10 times and get 8 heads. Is this a fair coin?

### Frequentist Analysis

```python
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Observed: 8 heads out of 10 flips
# H₀: p = 0.5 (fair coin)
# H₁: p ≠ 0.5 (unfair coin)

observed_heads = 8
n_flips = 10
null_p = 0.5

# Two-tailed binomial test
p_value = 2 * (1 - stats.binom.cdf(observed_heads - 1, n_flips, null_p))
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

# Result: p-value = 0.1094
# Conclusion: Fail to reject H₀ (not enough evidence to say it's unfair)
```

**Frequentist says:** "We can't conclude the coin is unfair (p = 0.11 > 0.05)."

### Bayesian Analysis

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

# Prior: Uniform distribution (all probabilities equally likely)
# This is equivalent to Beta(1, 1)
alpha_prior = 1
beta_prior = 1

# Data: 8 heads, 2 tails
heads = 8
tails = 2

# Posterior: Beta distribution (conjugate prior magic!)
alpha_posterior = alpha_prior + heads
beta_posterior = beta_prior + tails

# The posterior is Beta(9, 3)
posterior = stats.beta(alpha_posterior, beta_posterior)

# Plot the results
p_values = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)
prior_density = stats.beta(alpha_prior, beta_prior).pdf(p_values)
posterior_density = posterior.pdf(p_values)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(p_values, prior_density, 'b--', label='Prior belief', alpha=0.7)
plt.plot(p_values, posterior_density, 'r-', label='Posterior belief', linewidth=2)
plt.axvline(0.5, color='black', linestyle=':', label='Fair coin (p=0.5)')
plt.xlabel('Probability of Heads')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.title('Bayesian Coin Analysis: Before and After Data')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Calculate probabilities
prob_unfair = 1 - posterior.cdf(0.6) + posterior.cdf(0.4)
prob_very_unfair = 1 - posterior.cdf(0.7) + posterior.cdf(0.3)

print(f"Probability coin is unfair (p < 0.4 or p > 0.6): {prob_unfair:.3f}")
print(f"Probability coin is very unfair (p < 0.3 or p > 0.7): {prob_very_unfair:.3f}")
print(f"Most likely value of p: {posterior.mean():.3f}")
print(f"95% credible interval: [{posterior.ppf(0.025):.3f}, {posterior.ppf(0.975):.3f}]")
```

**Bayesian says:** "There's a 67% chance the coin is significantly unfair, and the most likely probability of heads is 0.75. Here's my full uncertainty about all possible values..."

## When to Use Which Approach?

### Use **Frequentist Methods** When:
- You need regulatory approval (FDA, etc.) - they often require frequentist approaches
- You want to control false positive rates in multiple testing scenarios
- You have no meaningful prior information
- You need simple, standardized procedures that others can easily replicate
- You're doing exploratory data analysis where you want to "let the data speak"

### Use **Bayesian Methods** When:
- You have genuine prior information that should influence the analysis
- You want to quantify uncertainty about parameters (not just reject/accept hypotheses)
- You need to make optimal decisions under uncertainty
- You want interpretable probability statements about your hypotheses
- You're building predictive models
- You have complex, hierarchical data structures
- Sample sizes are small and every bit of information matters

## The Integration Perspective

Here's the thing: these approaches aren't always mutually exclusive. Modern statistics increasingly recognizes that:

1. **Both have their place**: Different questions call for different tools
2. **Bayesian methods can be more intuitive**: They answer the questions we actually want to ask
3. **Frequentist methods provide important guarantees**: They control error rates in repeated sampling
4. **The gap is narrowing**: Modern computational methods make Bayesian analysis more accessible

## A Personal Take

After working extensively with both approaches, I find myself gravitating toward Bayesian methods for most real-world problems. Here's why:

**Bayesian modeling feels more honest about uncertainty.** Instead of binary reject/don't-reject decisions, you get nuanced probability distributions that capture what you actually know and don't know.

**It's more flexible for complex problems.** Once you understand the Bayesian framework, you can tackle mixture models, hierarchical structures, and missing data in ways that frequentist methods struggle with.

**It answers the questions we actually care about.** When someone asks "What's the probability this treatment works?", Bayesian analysis can give a direct answer.

But here's the key insight: **The best approach depends on your specific problem, your audience, and your goals.**

## Moving Forward

If you're coming from a traditional statistics background, I encourage you to:

1. **Start with simple Bayesian analyses** on problems you understand well
2. **Compare results** between frequentist and Bayesian approaches
3. **Focus on interpretation** - what do the results actually mean?
4. **Think about your priors** - what do you actually believe before seeing the data?

The future of statistics isn't about choosing sides in some philosophical war. It's about understanding both approaches deeply enough to choose the right tool for each specific problem.

And honestly? Once you start thinking like a Bayesian, it's hard to go back. The world just makes more sense when you can explicitly model your uncertainty and update your beliefs as evidence accumulates.
